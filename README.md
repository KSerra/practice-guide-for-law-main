# Practice Guide for Law

Pretty formatted version of the Practice Guide for Computer, with the Computer replaced with law -- [see
PDF](guide.pdf).

Based on code from here - https://codeberg.org/oneirophage/practice-guide-for-computer

Don't print directly from Firefox; there's a bug in the PDF rendering (only when
printing) that cuts off some characters. Download the file and then print it
with the system dialog.
